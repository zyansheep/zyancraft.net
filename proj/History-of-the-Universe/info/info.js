As it expanded and cooled, the energy formed into quarks, then protons and neutrons, and then atoms. The atoms eventually formed the first stars and solar systems. The big bang also inspired the idea of constantly accelerating, expanding universe. (Aka, The Red Shift Theory)"

Oparin and English geneticist J.B.S Haldane. These scientists theorized that during 540 million year period before life formed on earth, the conditions and chances should have existed somewhere on earth during that period for life to form."

Darwin's main ideas were conveyed through his book On the Origin of Species, published in 1859."
